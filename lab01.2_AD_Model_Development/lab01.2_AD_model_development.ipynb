    "# Model Development\n",
    "\n",
    "In the introductory lab, we encountered alternative approaches to anomaly detection.  We implemented our own solution to labeling data points that were several standard deviations from the mean of all data points.  Then we estimated linear and seasonal trends in the time series, and removed them to perform anomaly detection on the remaining time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to apply this approach to our telemetry data.  We will first develop a solution that processes all the data in **batch**, and then optimize the solution so that it detects anomalies **online**, whenever new sensor measurements arrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reasons why we want to move to an online solution:\n",
    "- We don't want to repeatedely process historic data over and over again, this would be a waste of computing resources and time.\n",
    "- We should only store as much historic data as necessary for robust online anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will do the following:\n",
    "- Use python port [pyculiarity](https://github.com/nicolasmiller/pyculiarity) of [Twitter's anomaly detection R library](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection)\n",
    "- Do some data preprocessing to clean up our timeseries data\n",
    "- Apply this library to detect anomalies in our telemetry data\n",
    "- Adapt our solution to perform online anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have two objectives:\n",
    "1. Find a way to calculate running averages online\n",
    "2. Determine how much historic data we need to retain without losing our ability to robustly detect anomalies"
